# provider-externaldata

`provider-externaldata` is a minimal [Crossplane](https://crossplane.io/) Provider
that can be used to retrieve data from external sources. This provider does not *create* any
'real' resources, but fakes the creation, update and deletion of a resource as it loads
data from external sources. It currently supports retrieving data from:

- A `ConfigMap` within the current Kubernetes cluster. This requires
  a `namespace` value to be configured on the `ProviderConfig`, and allows the cluster admin
  to control where data can be retrieved from.
- A URI containing JSON, retrieved using `go-resty`. Note: this will be retrieved at least _once_ per reconciliation loop of the resource, and the request must take less than one second.

**WARNING**: This isn't exactly efficient because you need to have a `DataSource` instance inside each XR that requires the data. If your data source is well optimised then this should not be an issue until you have a _LOT_ of XR's, but bear in mind - no caching is done on the part of `provider-externaldata` so your data endpoint will receive 1-2x as many HTTP requests as the number of resources you have, every reconciliation loop (which, if up to date, will be around every 5 minutes).

## Usage

**STATUS**: Alpha. Tested locally using `kind` but not used in anger outside of the examples. Feel free to give it a shot if you have a use-case for it but this code is provided as-is, without warranty or liability. If you find something broken then feel free to submit an issue or a PR to fix it.

    Description:    This is a fantastic version of an Italian classic. The feta cheese adds a rich flavor that brings this dish to life. Incredibly easy and incredibly delicious!
    Directions:
      Stir together olive oil, garlic, and salt; toss with tomatoes, and allow to stand for 15 minutes.
      Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).
      Brush each pizza crust with some of the tomato marinade. Sprinkle the pizzas evenly with Mozzarella and Fontina cheeses. Arrange tomatoes overtop, then sprinkle with shredded basil, Parmesan, and feta cheese.
      Bake in preheated oven until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, about 10 minutes.
    Ingredients:
      1/4 cup olive oil
      1 tablespoon minced garlic
      1/2 teaspoon sea salt
      8 Roma tomatoes, sliced
      2 (12 inch) pre-baked pizza crusts
      8 ounces shredded Mozzarella cheese
      4 ounces shredded Fontina cheese
      10 fresh basil leaves, washed, dried
      1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese
      1/2 cup crumbled feta cheese
